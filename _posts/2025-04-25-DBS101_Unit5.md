# Unit 5: Normalization and Functional Dependencies

## Introduction to Good Relational Designs

A good relational database design should have these key features:

1. **Relation for every entity**
   - Each tuple represents one entity or relationship
   - Attributes of different entities should not be mixed
   - Foreign keys should reference other entities
   - Entity and relationship attributes should be separate

2. **Minimal NULL values**
   - Relations should be designed to minimize NULL values
   - Attributes frequently NULL can be moved to separate relations

3. **No spurious tuples**
   - Avoid designs that produce erroneous JOIN results
   - Ensure "lossless join" property for meaningful results

4. **No redundancy**
   - Avoid storing the same data in multiple places
   - Redundancy creates problems:
     - Wasted storage space
     - Multiple data entry points
     - Multiple deletion points
     - Multiple modification points

5. **No modification anomalies**
   - **Update anomaly**: Changing data in one place but not others creates inconsistency
   - **Deletion anomaly**: Deleting data about one entity accidentally removes data about another
   - **Insertion anomaly**: Cannot add certain data because other required data is unavailable

## Normalization Theory

Normalization is a database design technique that:
- Reduces data redundancy
- Makes information retrieval easier
- Converts database design into standard formats (normal forms)

The approach is to decompose relational schemas that are not in "good form" into appropriate normal forms with lossless decomposition.

## Functional Dependencies

A functional dependency (FD) is a relationship between attributes where one attribute's value determines another's value.

Notation: X → Y
- X is the determinant
- Y is the dependent

### Closure of Functional Dependencies (F+)

- F+ contains all functional dependencies logically implied by a set F
- Armstrong's axioms provide rules for reasoning about dependencies:
  - **Reflexivity**: If β ⊆ α, then α → β
  - **Augmentation**: If α → β holds, then γα → γβ holds
  - **Transitivity**: If α → β and β → γ hold, then α → γ holds


### Closure of Attribute Sets

Example:

F = { A → B, B → C, A → D }
A+ = { A } (start with attribute A)
Apply FDs:
1. A → B: Add B to A+, now A+ = { A, B }
2. B → C: Add C to A+, now A+ = { A, B, C }
3. A → D: Add D to A+, now A+ = { A, B, C, D }
Therefore A+ = { A, B, C, D }


### Canonical Cover

A canonical cover (Fc) is a simplified version of F with the same meaning but no redundancy.

An attribute is extraneous if we can remove it without changing the closure of the set of FDs.

## Normal Forms

![Anomalies Example](/assets/unit5/image3.png)

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- All attributes must have atomic (indivisible) values
- No repeating groups or arrays

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Must be in 1NF
- All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
A relation R is in 3NF if for all FDs α → β:
- α → β is trivial (β ⊆ α), or
- α is a superkey, or
- Each attribute in β-α is contained in a candidate key

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
A relation R is in BCNF if for all FDs α → β:
- α → β is trivial (β ⊆ α), or
- α is a superkey

BCNF is stricter than 3NF and eliminates more anomalies, but may not preserve all dependencies.

## Decomposition Algorithms

### BCNF Decomposition Algorithm
1. Start with a single relation R
2. Find a functional dependency α → β that violates BCNF
3. Decompose R into:
   - (α ∪ β)
   - (R - (β - α))
4. Repeat until all relations are in BCNF

### 3NF Decomposition Algorithm
1. Find a canonical cover Fc for F
2. Create a relation for each FD in Fc
3. If no schema contains a candidate key, add one
4. Remove redundant schemas

## Multivalued Dependencies and Higher Normal Forms

### Multivalued Dependencies
A multivalued dependency X →→ Y holds if X values are independent of combining Y values with other values.

Example: In inst(ID, dept_name, name, street, city), ID →→ street, city means an instructor's address is independent of their department.

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
A schema is in 4NF if whenever a non-trivial multivalued dependency X →→ Y holds, X is a superkey.

### Higher Normal Forms
- **Fifth Normal Form (5NF/PJNF)**: Eliminates redundancies from join dependencies
- **Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF)**: Based on even more general constraints

## Modeling Temporal Data

Temporal data is valid only over specific time periods.

To model temporal data:
1. Add start_date and end_date columns to relations
2. Primary keys must include time period to prevent overlaps
3. Functional dependencies only hold at specific points in time

Example:

course (course_id, title, dept_name, credits, start_date, end_date)


Foreign keys become more complex with temporal data, requiring validity across time periods.

SQL: 2011 added some temporal support with PERIOD FOR and temporal constraints.


## Key Takeaways

- Normalization improves database design by reducing redundancy and anomalies
- Each normal form addresses specific types of dependencies and constraints
- BCNF provides better normalization but may sacrifice dependency preservation
- 3NF offers a balance between normalization and dependency preservation
- Higher normal forms address more complex dependencies but are rarely used in practice
- Temporal data modeling requires special consideration for time-varying attributes
