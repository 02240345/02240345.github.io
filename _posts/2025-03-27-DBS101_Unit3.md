# Unit 3: SQL and Database Operations

After completing Units 1 and 2, I now have a 
solid understanding of database concepts and 
the relational model. Unit 3 
introduced SQL (Structured Query Language) and 
database operations, which are essential 
skills for working with relational 
databases.

## ACID Properties of Databases

A transaction is a single logical unit of work 
that accesses and possibly modifies the 
contents of a database. The ACID 
properties ensure database transactions are 
processed reliably:

![ACID Properties](/assets/unit3/image1.png)

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations 
within a transaction are completed 
successfully or none at all
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the database 
remains in a consistent state before and after 
the transaction
- **Isolation**: Ensures that concurrent 
execution of transactions results in a system 
state that would be obtained if 
transactions were executed sequentially
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a 
transaction has been committed, it will remain 
committed even in case of system failure

## SQL Fundamentals

SQL was originally developed by IBM as part of 
the System R project in the 1970s. It has 
become the standard language for 
relational database management systems.

### Parts of SQL

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Used to 
define database structures
2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Used 
to manipulate data
3. **Integrity**: Used to ensure data integrity
4. **View Definition**: Used to create views
5. **Transaction Control**: Used to control 
transactions
6. **Embedded SQL and Dynamic SQL**: Used to 
embed SQL in other languages
7. **Authorization**: Used to control access 
to data

### Basic SQL Data Types

![SQL Data Types](/assets/unit3/image4.jpg)

SQL supports various data types including:
- Character types (CHAR, VARCHAR)
- Numeric types (INT, SMALLINT, NUMERIC, REAL, 
DOUBLE PRECISION)
- Date and time types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP)
- Boolean type (BOOLEAN)

### Constraints in SQL

Constraints ensure data integrity by 
specifying rules for the data in a table:

- **NOT NULL**: Ensures a column cannot have 
NULL values
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column 
are different
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Combines NOT NULL and 
UNIQUE constraints
- **FOREIGN KEY**: Prevents actions that would 
destroy links between tables
- **CHECK**: Ensures values in a column 
satisfy a specific condition
- **DEFAULT**: Sets a default value for a 
column

## Database Operations

### Creating and Managing Databases

The process of working with databases involves:
1. Creating a database
2. Creating tables with appropriate columns 
and constraints
3. Inserting data into tables
4. Querying data from tables

### Airline Ticketing System Example

We worked on an Airline Ticketing System 
database as our practical example:

![Airline Ticketing System ERD](/assets/unit3/image2.png)

We converted this ERD into a relational schema 
and implemented it using SQL.

## SQL Queries

### Basic Query Structure

SQL queries follow a basic structure:
- SELECT: Specifies which columns to retrieve
- FROM: Specifies which tables to query
- WHERE: Filters records based on conditions

### Query Clauses

- **WHERE**: Filters records based on 
conditions
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set
- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows with the same 
values
- **HAVING**: Filters groups based on 
conditions

### Working with Multiple Tables

SQL allows querying data from multiple tables 
using table joins and subqueries.

## Advanced SQL Concepts

### NULL Values in SQL

NULL values represent missing or unknown 
information and require special handling:

- In arithmetic operations, if any input is 
NULL, the result is NULL
- In comparison operations, comparing with 
NULL results in "unknown" (not true/false)
- SQL uses three-valued logic: true, false, 
and unknown

### Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a 
set of values and return a single value:

- **AVG()**: Calculates the average of values
- **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows
- **MAX()**: Finds the maximum value
- **MIN()**: Finds the minimum value
- **SUM()**: Calculates the sum of values

### Nested Subqueries

Subqueries are queries nested within another 
query, allowing for more complex operations:

![Nested Subqueries Example](/assets/unit3/

Types of nested query result expressions:
- **ALL**: Must satisfy expression for all 
rows in subquery
- **ANY**: Must satisfy expression for at 
least one row in subquery
- **IN**: Equivalent to =ANY()
- **EXISTS**: At least one row is returned

### Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across a 
set of related rows:

- They allow calculations without grouping 
rows into a single output row
- They can calculate aggregates, rankings, and 
other analytical tasks
- The OVER clause specifies how to group 
tuples when computing the window function

## Looking Ahead

Unit 3 completely reshaped the way I see databases. It wasn’t just about memorizing SQL syntax—it was about understanding how data is managed, structured, and retrieved efficiently. I explored ACID properties, mastered queries from the simplest to the most intricate nested subqueries, and, most importantly, got to apply these skills in a real-world scenario. Working with the Airline Ticketing System brought everything to life, turning abstract concepts into tangible problem-solving skills.
