# SQL Database Systems Fundamentals

## Introduction

In this blog, I'll be covering key concepts in SQL 
database systems, including joins, views, integrity
constraints, data types, schemas, indexes, authorization, 
SQL from programming languages, functions, procedures, 
triggers, and recursive queries.

## Join Expressions

### Natural Join

Natural join performs a Cartesian product, finds consistent 
tuples, and deletes inconsistent tuples, and also removes 
duplicate attributes. It requires at least one common 
attribute between two tables.

### Join Types and Conditions

* **Inner Join**: This type of join does not preserve 
non-matched tuples. It's the default join type when no outer 
prefix is specified. Natural join is a type of inner join.
* **Outer Join**: This join returns both matched and 
unmatched values from either or both tables.
* **LEFT JOIN**: Returns unmatched rows from the left table 
and matched rows from both tables.
* **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns unmatched rows from the right 
table and matched rows from both tables.
* **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns unmatched rows from both 
tables and matched rows from both tables.

## Views

A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of 
an SQL statement. Views can simplify complex queries, 
enhance security, and present data flexibly. They don't 
store data on disk but retrieve it dynamically each time 
they are accessed.

### Materialized Views

Some database systems allow view relations to be stored and 
ensure they are kept up-to-date when the actual relations 
change. These are called materialized views.

### Updatable Views

A SQL view is updatable if it meets certain conditions, such 
as having only one database relation in the FROM clause, 
containing only attribute names in the SELECT clause, and 
not having a GROUP BY or HAVING clause.


## Integrity Constraints

Integrity constraints ensure that changes to the database by 
authorized users do not result in a loss of data consistency.
Types of integrity constraints include:

1.  Entity Integrity Constraints
2.  Domain Constraints
3.  Referential Integrity Constraints
4.  Key Constraints 

## SQL Data Types and Schemas

SQL includes various data types, type conversion functions, 
and the ability to set default values for columns. It also 
supports large-object types (CLOB, BLOB) for storing large 
data items. Users can define their own data types and 
domains. Additionally, SQL provides features for generating 
unique key values and auto-incrementing fields.

## Schemas, Catalogs, and Environments

Database systems have evolved to use hierarchical structures 
with catalogs, schemas, and relations. This organization 
helps in avoiding naming conflicts and allows users and 
applications to work independently.

## Index Definition in SQL

An index is a data structure that allows the database system 
to efficiently find tuples with specified values without 
scanning the entire relation. Indexes can be created, 
declared as unique, and deleted using SQL statements.

## Authorization

Authorization in SQL includes privileges to read, insert, 
update, and delete data. The `GRANT` statement is used to 
confer authorization, and the `REVOKE` statement is used to 
revoke privileges. Authorization can also be managed through 
roles and views.

## Accessing SQL from a Programming Language

SQL can be accessed from general-purpose programming 
languages using dynamic SQL or embedded SQL. JDBC and ODBC 
are common standards for connecting to SQL databases.

## Functions and Procedures in SQL

SQL allows the definition of functions and procedures to 
perform specific tasks. Functions can be executed within a 
SELECT statement and always return a single value, while 
procedures are explicitly called and may or may not return a 
value. SQL also supports external language routines.

## Triggers in SQL

A trigger is a statement that the system executes 
automatically as a side effect of a modification to the 
database. Triggers are used for enforcing integrity 
constraints, alerting humans, or starting tasks 
automatically.

## Recursion in SQL

Recursive SQL common table expressions (CTEs) are queries 
that continuously reference a previous result until they 
return an empty result. The SQL standard supports a limited 
form of recursion using the `WITH RECURSIVE` clause.

## Advanced Aggregation Functions

SQL provides advanced aggregation functions to perform 
complex data analysis and reporting.

## Conclusion

From unit4, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of 
several key SQL concepts and techniques.

* I learned how to implement different types of joins in 
SQL, including inner, outer, and natural joins, to combine 
data from multiple tables effectively.

* I also learned to create and implement SQL views, which 
are virtual tables that simplify complex queries and enhance 
data security.

* The lessons covered SQL transactions and how to implement 
integrity constraints to maintain data consistency.

* I now understand how to define SQL data types and schemas, 
and how to create and implement indexes using SQL statements 
to improve query performance.

* Additionally, I explored SQL authorization concepts, 
learning how to control access to data, and how to access 
SQL from a programming language using standards like JDBC.

* Finally, I learned to implement functions, procedures, and 
triggers in SQL to encapsulate logic and automate database 
operations, and to write recursive queries and use advanced 
aggregation features for more complex data analysis..
