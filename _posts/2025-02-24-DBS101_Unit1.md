# Unit 1: Database Systems Fundamentals

Before starting this course, my understanding of databases was pretty basic. I thought of them as just Excel spreadsheets on 
steroids—a place where you store data and retrieve it when needed. I had heard of terms like SQL, MySQL, and DBMS, but 
honestly, I didn’t fully grasp how they all fit together.

Now that I’ve completed Unit 1, my perspective has completely changed. Databases are not just about storing data; they are 
about organizing, securing, and managing information efficiently. They form the backbone of modern technology, from banking 
systems to social media platforms.

## What I Learned in Unit 1

**Why We Need Database Systems**

Before this course, I never thought about why we need databases. But when we compared them to traditional file storage (Excel, 
physical records, etc.), it became clear why databases are the better choice.


**The Evolution of Databases**

I was surprised to learn that databases weren’t always as advanced as they are today.
Early databases were storing data in a tree-like structure.

Then came network databases, which introduced more complex relationships.

Finally, relational databases (RDBMS) like MySQL and PostgreSQL became the gold standard.
This historical perspective helped me understand why SQL and relational databases are so important today.

**Data Models and ER Diagrams**

One of the most fun parts of this unit was learning about Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams. Before, I never really thought 
about how data is structured behind the scenes.

We created ER diagrams that showed how students, courses, and instructors are connected in a university database. It felt like 
solving a puzzle—figuring out how entities relate to each other and ensuring that no data gets duplicated unnecessarily.

#### Data Abstraction

There are three levels of data abstraction that we have learned which are;

1. Physical level : descibes how data are stored.
2. Logical level : descibes what data are stored in the database and how they are related.
3. View level : descibes how the users see the database.

#### Database Languages

There are two different database languages that we have learned which are;

1. Data-definition language - Creating a design for the database like tables.

2. Data Manipulation language - Enables users to access or manipulate data by retrieving, inserting, deleting and modifying.

#### Database Engine
Components of database engine are;

1. Storage manager - deals with the data storage and data retrieval.

2. Query prosessor - it interprets, compiles and evaluates using DDL interpreter, DML compiler and Query evaluation engine.

3. Transaction management - The transaction manager consists of the concurrency-control manager and the recovery manager.

**How My Perspective Has Changed**

At the beginning of this course, I thought databases were just for storing data. Now, I realize they are about efficiency, security, and scalability.

**Key Realizations:**

- Databases are everywhere, even in things I use daily.
- Security is a big deal—proper database management prevents data leaks and cyber threats.
- SQL is an essential skill for anyone working with data.

**Looking Ahead**

Databases are more than just a subject in my curriculum—they are a critical skill that can open doors in tech, business, and 
beyond in our country. We were just getting started with databases and it was a valuable lesson for us and i am looking forward 
to what's coming next.
