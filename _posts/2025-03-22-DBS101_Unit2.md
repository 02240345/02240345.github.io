# Unit 2: Relational Model and Schema Design

After finishing Unit 1, I felt I had a basic understanding of what databases are and why they are important.  However, Unit 2
focused on the **Relational Model** and **Schema Design** and it changed my perspective on databases.  I understood that
databases are more than just holding data, they're also about arranging it in such a way that it's easy to access change and
scale as necessary.

## What I Learned in Unit 2

**The Relational Model**

Unit 1 focused on the relational concept while Unit 2 discusses further into it.  I learned that the relational approach
involves arranging data into tables or relations with rows and columns. Each table represents a single entity (such as a
student or a course) whereas the columns represent properties (such as name, age or course ID).

Understanding the primary and foreign keys was one of the most important points. Primary keys identify each row in a table
whereas foreign keys create connections between tables. It also demonstrated how to link data from separate tables without
duplicating the information.


**Schema Design**

Schema design was another important topic in this unit. I discovered that a **database schema** is an approach for how data is 
organized in a database.  It defines the database's structure which includes tables, columns, data types and relationships 
between tables.

We also learned about **normalization**, which is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data
integrity.  Normalization is breaking down the tables into smaller and easier to manage sections and ensuring that each piece 
of data is only saved in one location. 

**ERD to Relational Schema Translation**

One of the most beneficial aspects of this unit was learning how to convert an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to a
relational schema.  We transformed the ERD we constructed in Unit 1 into a set of tables that had primary keys, foreign keys 
and relationships.  This exercise helped me understand how the conceptual design (ERD) transfers into the actual database 
structure.

Here’s an example of an ERD we worked on:

And here’s how we translated it into a relational schema:

**Relational Algebra**

We also discussed **relational algebra**, which is a formal system for manipulating relationships (tables) in databases.  
Selection, projection, union, intersection and join are some of the operations in relational algebra.  Understanding these 
processes was essential since they serve as the foundation for SQL queries.

Here is an easy example of a relational algebra operation:

- **Selection**: σ (StudentNo="12345")  (Student) - This selects all rows from the Student table where the StudentNo is "12345".

- **Projection**: Π (Name, Address) (Student) - This projects only the Name and Address columns from the Student table.

**How My Perspective Has Changed**

Before this unit, I thought of databases as just a collection of tables. Now I know them as highly structured systems with 
well-designed schemas that ensure data integrity and efficiency. I also have a better understanding of how data is linked 
between tables and how to create a database with little redundancy.

**Key Realizations:**

- The relational model is the foundation of most modern databases.
- Schema design is crucial for creating efficient and scalable databases.
- Normalization is key to reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.
- Relational algebra is the backbone of SQL queries.

**Looking Ahead**

Unit 2 was a deep dive into the relational model and schema design, and it really helped me understand how databases are 
structured and how to design them effectively. I’m excited to see what’s next in Unit 3, where we’ll be diving into SQL and 
actually querying databases. I feel like I’m building a strong foundation, and I can’t wait to apply these concepts in 
real-world scenarios.
